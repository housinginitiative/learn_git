Collaboration is crucial to our work at HIP, and knowing how to use version control systems like git is necessary for smooth and effective collaborative work on code. It's also a way to make sure that our analyses are reproducible. Github is the most popular platform for hosting git repositories, and HIP's repositories are hosted here.

Getting set up with a git workflow does take some up-front investment, but it doesn't need to be difficult. Here are the steps you should follow before continuing.

1. Register a Github account if you don't have one. A straightforward rendering of your name in underscore or hyphen-separated all lowercase is recommended.
2. Join Penn's [Github Campus Program](https://github.com/upenn), which will allow you access to some features like private repositories.
3. Make sure [git is installed](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) in your system. If you have a Mac it's probably already installed.

Once you're set up, try cloning this repository then trying out some basic git actions like pushing and pulling; [this](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great resource specific to using git/github with R. Be sure to look at the start_here.R script under the scripts folder and follow the directions to make sure your personal Box path is set up. Remember: **NO** non-public data should be committed to git or stored anywhere other than Box.
